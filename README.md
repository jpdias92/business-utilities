A collection of loose scripts I use to help manage my business. Parsing bank extracts, organizing Amazon invoices, etc.

- [Amazon Invoices](./amazon_invoices/) - Split and rename Amazon invoices into a file per invoice.
- [Montepio Parser](./montepio_parser/]) - Parse the Montepio bank extract into a desired format.
